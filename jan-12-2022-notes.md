How do you know that taste is real and that the different words we use to describe different tastes actually describe different things?
The five basic tastes are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The purpose of this project is to statistically investigate the concept of flavour,
with the ultimate goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between language, belief and reality.
