# Introduction
How do you know that taste is real and that the different words we use to describe different tastes actually describe different things?
The five basic tastes are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The purpose of this project is to statistically investigate the concept of flavour,
with the ultimate goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between language, belief and reality.

If you gave m people n different foods and asked them to rank order the foods from least sweet to most sweet, least sour to most sour, and etc for all the flavours, you would basically get a 5 dimensional vector for each food from each person. each persons would get and n by 5 matrix that showed their rank ordering for each food along each flavour.
# Motivating Game
One weekend in late October Matthiue came to back to Wateloo to visit his friends Travis and Sagar. Matt and Travis went to Martin Family fruit farm to get some apples and walk around the scenic orchard. Travis found the apple store boring and wanted to make his apple experience more interesting, so he gathered one of each type of apple and took a picture of it next to its name. He had the intention of testing how well he knew the different types of apples by their appearance. When they got back to Travis's apartment, they wrote out their best guesses for the type of each apple and compared it with the gound truth photograph.

There were some flaws with the game. First of all, it was difficult to match the physical apple with the photograph that was taken in the store. The lighting had changed, the camera didn't pick up the texture of the skin accurately enough, etc... Second, it was difficult to keep track of all of the guesses. Each apple had two scraps of paper next to it. One scrap had Travis's guess and the other had Mattieu's guess. They also included guesses for flavour characteristics such as sweetest, sourest, crunchiest. As we cut into each apple to taste it, we took tried to decide on the ground truth. Could we reach an agreement on which apple was actually the sweetest.

The basic idea of the game is to expose the players to some information, in this case it was physical apples. And then ask them to give their best guess answers to the a set of questions based on the information they received.
